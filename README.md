# What this module does for you 

Studies show that having a faster site increase the conversion rate considerably. There are numerous benefits to speed optimization, such as:

    Increased search engine ranking
    Reduced bounce rate
    Increased conversations
    Increased sales
    User satisfaction
    Higher order amounts

PrestaShop in its own is very secure. It's among the most secure content management systems available. When said, its good practice to add extra layers of security. I added all these layers as features so you can enable them without any coding knowledge to follow best practice. 

# Requirements
    PrestaShop 1.7.1+
    PHP 7.1+

# What your customers will like

Nobody likes to wait. It makes us feel like we're not a company's top priority.

Consumers have even less patience when shopping online. Every second it takes your website to load, your chance of losing a customer increases.

Studies show that your visitors associate the responsiveness of your site with your brand's responsiveness overall. A slow site, in other words, suggests slow customer service, slow product innovation, and slow everything else.

# Installation
The installation of Performance Pro is 100 % according to PrestaShop's standards.

1. Login into your shop's back office
2. Go to "Module Manager"

# Other
## Does the module using overrides?
The module does not use overrides. None of the core files is modified, so you are entirely safe against conflicts between other modules.
As this is an all-in-one module, you do not need a bunch of performance modules that could be conflicting. All the features in this module are built to work together.

## Can I try the module?
There is a live demo of the module to try. This is highly recommended as some features are better explained in the demo.
If you have questions, do not hesitate to contact me.
